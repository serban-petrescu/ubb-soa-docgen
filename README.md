# Invoice Generator
A small application for managing the invoices of one or more companies.

## Setup
In order to run it locally, you need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed. Simply clone the project locally and run `docker-compose up` inside the root repository folder. The application should then be accessible on port `8000` of the docker host (e.g. localhost or 192.168.99.100).

Check out the [documentation](docs/documentation.md) for more details.
